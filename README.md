# JavaInstantMessenger
A Java IM client and server

Made in collaboration with:
Garreth Kennedy
Olivia Gill
Conor Marshall

Our group has set out to create an instant messenger using the Java language. We aimed to allow our users to run a client or server and send messages across all connected clients. We also aimed to allow for a certain amount of customisation for our application including custom GUIs, the ability to change the display name and changing font styles and sizes. We chose this project because wanted to try something different and more challenging with the Java language than what we have been learning in class.
